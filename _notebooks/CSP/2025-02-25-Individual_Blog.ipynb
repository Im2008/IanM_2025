    "## **Major Commits**:\n",
    "- Built API (api/competition.py) that fetches username based on a JWT authentication token from login, amount of time taken from fetching through api/competition/timer, and word given.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Made model file (model/competition.py) to create a seperate db tables inside of user_management.db to store information with fetched username, time, and given word, storing information inside database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Developed Deployment Blog with port 8203, overview of setup on backend page \n",
    "(scribble.stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com) [Assistant Deployment Admin]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Made navigation bar and nav to main homepage, styled individual page + deployment blog, changed readability on site. \n",
    "[Frontend Developer]\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Minor Commits**:\n",
    "- Changed overall JWT Token request from jwt_authorize.py to fetch user_name details and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusted port on makefile, put files such as /sass-cache/ into .gitignore to help with github deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Made issue on 4.2, 4.3 about fault tolerances and computing models (Sequential, Parallel, Distributed, Efficiency Comparisons).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features Showcase:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "- Competition is a timed drawing game that fetches users JSON data into an api (competition.py) and updates/stores progress after timer ends, such as the users (profile name, time taken, and a user's given word). \n",
    "- The user's saved data is stored within a separate model file named competition.py, which creates a separate db_table under user_manangement.db with separate variables from Competition.\n",

    "# Timer Status (started, or stopped) Fetch:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Repeated Execution:**  \n",
    "   - Start a recurring interval (`setInterval`) that executes every **1000ms (1 second)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition timer API endpoint (`/api/competition/timer`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process API Response:**  \n",
    "   - Await the API response and parse it into JSON format.  \n",
    "   - If the response status is not OK (`!response.ok`), throw an error with the server-provided message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Timer Display:**  \n",
    "   - Extract `time_remaining` from the API response.  \n",
    "   - Modify the DOM element with ID **`timerDisplay`** to display the remaining time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Timer State:**  \n",
    "   - If `is_active` is `false`, execute the following actions:  \n",
    "     - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`).  \n",
    "     - **Enable the \"Start Timer\" button** (`#startTimer`).  \n",
    "     - **Disable the \"Stop Timer\" button** (`#stopTimer`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:**  \n",
    "   - If any error occurs, log the error to the console.  \n",
    "   - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`) to prevent redundant API calls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Implementation\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function updateTimerDisplay() {\n",
    "    timerInterval = setInterval(async () => {\n",
    "        try {\n",
    "            const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/competition/timer`, {\n",
    "                method: 'GET',\n",
    "                credentials: 'include'\n",
    "            });\n",
    "\n",
    "            const data = await response.json();\n",
    "            if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.message);\n",
    "\n",
    "            document.getElementById('timerDisplay').textContent = \n",
    "                `Time: ${data.time_remaining}s`;\n",
    "\n",
    "            if (!data.is_active) {\n",
    "                clearInterval(timerInterval);\n",
    "                document.getElementById('startTimer').disabled = false;\n",
    "                document.getElementById('stopTimer').disabled = true;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "\n",
    "        } catch (error) {\n",
    "            console.error('Error:', error);\n",
    "            clearInterval(timerInterval);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements & Constraints\n",
    "- The function must be executed in a browser environment.\n",
    "- The API endpoint (`/api/competition/timer`) must be accessible and return a valid JSON response.\n",
    "- The target DOM elements (`#timerDisplay`, `#startTimer`, `#stopTimer`) must exist before function execution.\n",
    "- The function must handle network errors and API failures gracefully.\n",
    "- `setInterval` must be cleared when `is_active` is `false` to prevent unnecessary API calls.\n",

    "# User Results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To fetch competition result data from an API and update the user interface dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition results API endpoint (`/api/competition/times`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",

    "   - If not, throw an error with the message `'Failed to fetch results'`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process API Data:**  \n",
    "   - Parse the JSON response and extract the list of result entries.  \n",

    "   - Clear any existing content in the table body.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Populate Table with Results:**  \n",
    "   - Iterate through each entry in the response data.  \n",
    "   - Create a new table row (`<tr>`) for each entry.  \n",
    "   - Insert the following data into the corresponding cells (`<td>`):  \n",
