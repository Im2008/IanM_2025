    "# N@TM Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "During N@TM, we recieved a moderate feedback in regards to our site about the functionality of Scribble and the purpose of the project. When people tried to use our site, most people were able to figure out how to work the site, however didn't understand its efficiency and the general purpose of the website.\n",

    "What we could do in the future of fixing this issue is adding a purpose for the website at the main page (our index.md) instead of a regular drawing board at the start of the website. This way people are able to get a \"semi-tutorial\" of the website and what each link does with the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of how we'd fix this problem was with a group called Prism, where they put an explanation of their grading function while it was running. The page was simple without any hard navigation, and people were able to get the purpose of their website without any questions, as the idea and functions were basic.\n",

    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Repeated Execution:**  \n",
    "   - Start a recurring interval (`setInterval`) that executes every **1000ms (1 second)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition timer API endpoint (`/api/competition/timer`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process API Response:**  \n",
    "   - Await the API response and parse it into JSON format.  \n",
    "   - If the response status is not OK (`!response.ok`), throw an error with the server-provided message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Timer Display:**  \n",
    "   - Extract `time_remaining` from the API response.  \n",
    "   - Modify the DOM element with ID **`timerDisplay`** to display the remaining time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Timer State:**  \n",
    "   - If `is_active` is `false`, execute the following actions:  \n",
    "     - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`).  \n",
    "     - **Enable the \"Start Timer\" button** (`#startTimer`).  \n",
    "     - **Disable the \"Stop Timer\" button** (`#stopTimer`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:**  \n",
    "   - If any error occurs, log the error to the console.  \n",
    "   - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`) to prevent redundant API calls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Implementation\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function updateTimerDisplay() {\n",
    "    timerInterval = setInterval(async () => {\n",
    "        try {\n",

    "                method: 'GET',\n",
    "                credentials: 'include'\n",
    "            });\n",
    "\n",
    "            const data = await response.json();\n",
    "            if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.message);\n",

    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Template Inheritance & Styling**\n",
    "   - Extend the base template (`layouts/base.html`).\n",
    "   - Apply CSS styles to improve the UI, including:\n",

    "# MCQ: \n",
    "For the 2020 MCQ that I taken, I feel that i've understood the questions more effectively the more time I taken on it and re-reviewing the questions later on instead of spending around 4-6 minutes on one question. On the MCQ, the grade that i've gotten was an 53/67 comparable to the last MCQ where I got an 18/67.\n",

    "## Corrections:\n",
    "\n",
    "My weakest portion at the start were 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 3.4, & 3.7 where most of these big ideas were from the past, and would be better to re-review as I was more efficient on the newer big ideas rather than the smaller ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors**: For this section, I got a 43% out of 7 questions. What I should improve on in this question is understanding key terms when combined together such as conditions including if/else statements. Most of these questions during these big ideas asked to identify the terms and understand what is wrong with the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1: Binary Numbers**: For this section, I got an 80% out of 5 questions. Generally I understood the concept with binary numbers, at least for colors. For colors, multiplying ever number that has a 1 inside of it by 2, and it creates an rgb. However for regular binary, it mixed me up with understanding the difference between color and regular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3: Extracting Information from Data**: For this section, I got an 86% out of 7 questions. Overall, I think I did pretty decent in this section, however to improve on this big idea, its better to know key terms from the information provided in the question and how they coorelate with the problem faced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4: Strings**: For this section, I got a 0% out of 1 question. Generally I shouldn't have missed this one as strings are a key part of programming when referring to an object. What I should've focused on is re-reading the question and judging based on certain components of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.7: Nested Conditionals**: For this section, I recieved a 50% out of 2 questions. Generally I just have to re-read the problem and match statements like if/else statements, like if they're true or if they're false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/test.png\" alt=\"MCQ\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.12: Calling Procedures**: For this section, I got an 80% out of 5 questions. Overall, this section wasn't bad, however yet again it's better to re-read the questions, and like for nested conditions, its better to treat statements like true or false statements where you understand if something is true and correct anythhing if its false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.15: Random Values**: For this section, I received a 50% out of 2 questions. Overall I feel as if I didn't understand this section as well like Nested Conditionals. I felt to rush thsi section more and as a result got some of them barely correct. If I re-read the question and took my time in understanding what the question was asking, I'd have a better insight on what I could do to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.17: Algorithm Efficiency**: For this section, I got a 0% out of 2 questions. With this question, unlike the name I wasn't as efficient with this instance. To help better understand this topic, i'll re-review the lesson plans we've gotten from trimester 1 under my blogs about Algorithms, and get a basic insight about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1: The Internet**: For this section, I recieved a 75% out of 4 questions. Generally I felt I understood the questions well as I reviewed the video more effectively and reviewed based from what we took notes on. Overall I should spend more time on some problems than others as its better to get an understanding before going on to the next question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.2: Fault Tolerance**: For this section, I recieved a 50% out of 2 questions. For this big idea, I should've taken better notes with the videos posted on our AP classroom as they went briefly in depth with the ideas, and I should've went through the entire video instead of focusing only on taking notes. As a result, I didn't understand as much as fault tolerances other than it serves as a backup server for other servers that fail.\n",

    "## Strengths:\n",
    "My general strengths in the MCQ were the code segments, specifically sections 1-2 where sections would give ideas such as algorithms, for loops, if/else statements, and variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses:\n",
    "My General weaknesses were the questions generally built like an FRQ such as section 3, and section 5-6, as those sections discussed primarily about certain definitions that I had to make an educated guess about. For what I can improve on this Weakness, I should've used the slash tool more often to cross off obvious wrong answers and leave it with only 2 answers for me to self grade, as right after submitting, when re-reviewing my questions, I had to second guess myself to the point where the slash tool helped with correcting most of the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Self-Assessment\n",
    "Overall in this trimester, I felt that even though I was able to help organize the page and have my general features running and connected to one another, most of my commits were primarly focused on one specific assessments, which wasted the amount of things I was able to do and made my work habits less productive. Because of this, I began to fall a bit behind with making an individual admin page for my website, making deployment blogs for the website, and fixing and adjusting navigation pages.\n",

    "Looking further I'll attempt to become more productive with tasks and understand what i'm doing as well. This could be done with making more effective burndown lists at the start, and mark things down with what is achievable and what isn't."
