    "- Competition is a timed drawing game that fetches users JSON data into an api (competition.py) and updates/stores progress after timer ends, such as the users (profile name, time taken, and a user's given word). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The user's saved data is stored within a separate model file named competition.py, which creates a separate db_table under user_manangement.db with separate variables from Competition.\n",

    "# N@TM Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "During N@TM, we recieved a moderate feedback in regards to our site about the functionality of Scribble and the purpose of the project. When people tried to use our site, most people were able to figure out how to work the site, however didn't understand its efficiency and the general purpose of the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in my Competition page, people were able to understand the jist of drawing under a given word with a given time limit, however didn't get why the data would be stored and the overall purpose of storing the data. In the future, I can fix this issue by adjusting where the overall results would go, as we could add boosts that users can use to increase their time efficiency, or link the leaderboard to show the best drawings instead of fastest time.\n",

    "# Timer Status (started, or stopped) Fetch:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Repeated Execution:**  \n",
    "   - Start a recurring interval (`setInterval`) that executes every **1000ms (1 second)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition timer API endpoint (`/api/competition/timer`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process API Response:**  \n",
    "   - Await the API response and parse it into JSON format.  \n",
    "   - If the response status is not OK (`!response.ok`), throw an error with the server-provided message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Timer Display:**  \n",
    "   - Extract `time_remaining` from the API response.  \n",
    "   - Modify the DOM element with ID **`timerDisplay`** to display the remaining time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Timer State:**  \n",
    "   - If `is_active` is `false`, execute the following actions:  \n",
    "     - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`).  \n",
    "     - **Enable the \"Start Timer\" button** (`#startTimer`).  \n",
    "     - **Disable the \"Stop Timer\" button** (`#stopTimer`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:**  \n",
    "   - If any error occurs, log the error to the console.  \n",
    "   - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`) to prevent redundant API calls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Implementation\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function updateTimerDisplay() {\n",
    "    timerInterval = setInterval(async () => {\n",

    "To fetch competition result data from an API and update the user interface dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition results API endpoint (`/api/competition/times`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Template Inheritance & Styling**\n",
    "   - Extend the base template (`layouts/base.html`).\n",
    "   - Apply CSS styles to improve the UI, including:\n",
    "     - White background with padding and shadow for the container.\n",
    "     - Speed factor color coding based on performance.\n",

    "### **2. Render Competition Data in a Table**\n",
    "   - Create a responsive HTML table (`#competitionTable`).\n",

    "   - Conditionally display the **Delete** button for Admin users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Admin-Only Delete Functionality**\n",
    "   - If the user role is `'Admin'`, enable the **Delete** button.\n",
    "   - Use JavaScript to:\n",
    "     - Attach click events to `.delete-btn`.\n",
    "     - Confirm deletion before sending an API request.\n",
    "     - Send a `DELETE` request to `/api/competition/times` with the entry ID.\n",
    "     - Reload the page upon success or show an error message upon failure.\n",

    "### **4. Initialize DataTable (for Enhanced Table Management)**\n",
    "   - Use jQuery DataTables to:\n",
    "     - Enable sorting (default: by speed factor descending).\n",
    "     - Set pagination (`pageLength: 25`).\n",

    "# MCQ: \n",
    "For the 2020 MCQ that I taken, I feel that i've understood the questions more effectively the more time I taken on it and re-reviewing the questions later on instead of spending around 4-6 minutes on one question. On the MCQ, the grade that i've gotten was an 53/67 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths:\n",
    "My general strengths in the MCQ were the code segments, specifically sections 1-2 where sections would give ideas such as algorithms, for loops, if/else statements, and variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses:\n",
    "My General weaknesses were the questions generally built like an FRQ such as section 3, and section 5-6, as those sections discussed primarily about certain definitions that I had to make an educated guess about. For what I can improve on this Weakness, I should've used the slash tool more often to cross off obvious wrong answers and leave it with only 2 answers for me to self grade, as right after submitting, when re-reviewing my questions, I had to second guess myself to the point where the slash tool helped with correcting most of the questions.\n",

    "## Corrections:\n",

    "# Self-Assessment\n",
    "Overall in this trimester, I felt that even though I was able to help organize the page and have my general features running and connected to one another, most of my commits were primarly focused on one specific assessments, which wasted the amount of things I was able to do and made my work habits less productive. Because of this, I began to fall a bit behind with making an individual admin page for my website, making deployment blogs for the website, and fixing and adjusting navigation pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 things you did over 12 weeks, Issues, burndown, presentation (4/5): Commited, however focused too much on one subject that it limited how much work I did for others in regards to my role as Assisstant Deployment Admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 points - Full Stack Project Demo, including CPT requirement highlights, and N@tM feedback (2/2)\n",
    "1 point - Project Feature blog write up, using CPT/FRQ language (1/1)\n",
    "1 point - MCQ  (1/1)\n",
    "\n",
    "10th point (0.5/1): Mentioned strengths and weaknessess, plans on going forward but not much depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall (8.5/10)"
