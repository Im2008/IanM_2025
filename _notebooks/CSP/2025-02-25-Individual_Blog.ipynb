    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Repeated Execution:**  \n",
    "   - Start a recurring interval (`setInterval`) that executes every **1000ms (1 second)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition timer API endpoint (`/api/competition/timer`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process API Response:**  \n",
    "   - Await the API response and parse it into JSON format.  \n",
    "   - If the response status is not OK (`!response.ok`), throw an error with the server-provided message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Timer Display:**  \n",
    "   - Extract `time_remaining` from the API response.  \n",
    "   - Modify the DOM element with ID **`timerDisplay`** to display the remaining time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Timer State:**  \n",
    "   - If `is_active` is `false`, execute the following actions:  \n",
    "     - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`).  \n",
    "     - **Enable the \"Start Timer\" button** (`#startTimer`).  \n",
    "     - **Disable the \"Stop Timer\" button** (`#stopTimer`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:**  \n",
    "   - If any error occurs, log the error to the console.  \n",
    "   - **Stop the interval** (`clearInterval(timerInterval)`) to prevent redundant API calls.  \n",

    "## Procedure Steps\n",

    "1. **Perform API Request:**  \n",
    "   - Send an **asynchronous HTTP GET request** to the competition results API endpoint (`/api/competition/times`).  \n",
    "   - Include credentials (`'include'`) for authentication/session handling.  \n",

    "## Procedure Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Template Inheritance & Styling**\n",
    "   - Extend the base template (`layouts/base.html`).\n",
    "   - Apply CSS styles to improve the UI, including:\n",

    "     - Attach click events to `.delete-btn`.\n",
    "     - Confirm deletion before sending an API request.\n",

The page was simple without any hard navigation, and people were able to get the purpose of their website without any questions, as the idea and functions were basic. For example, their website was able to fit CPT requirements due to the idea of grading systems, and how admins can create or delete a students score, giving a purpose for teachers and a goal for students. Contrast to Scribble, although our website was able to fulfill CPT requirements in a way, my contribution of implementing competition between players may be confusing for other players and doesn't have a clear goal overall. \n",
