    "# AP CSP Study Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I will review all key topics outlined in the AP CSP curriculum, focusing on areas like algorithms, data structures, and abstraction.\n",
    "2. I will practice solving multiple-choice questions and writing free-response answers from past AP exams to familiarize myself with the test format.\n",
    "3. I will focus on understanding the concepts behind each computational thinking skill, especially programming, problem-solving, and data analysis.\n",
    "4. I will make sure to practice coding regularly, using tools like Scratch, Java, or Python, to improve my ability to write efficient code.\n",
    "5. I will use study groups or online resources to discuss difficult concepts and clarify any confusion I may have about specific topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5 Bullet Point Score Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strength in Identifying Correct Answers**: Demonstrated a solid understanding of computational concepts by correctly identifying why specific answers are correct, such as the time complexity of binary search and the proper use of conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improvement in Error Analysis**: Effectively analyzed why incorrect answers fail, such as recognizing logical contradictions or flaws in algorithmic assumptions, showcasing growth in critical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus on Algorithmic Understanding**: Highlighted the importance of understanding algorithmic efficiency and problem-solving limitations, reflecting a deeper grasp of computational thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attention to Procedural Logic**: Successfully identified procedural errors, such as the need to adjust loop conditions or sequence operations, indicating improved debugging skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commitment to Study Goals**: Maintained alignment with study strategies, including practicing coding, reviewing key topics, and leveraging study groups, ensuring consistent progress toward AP CSP readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# CPT and PPR Preparationsions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strength in Understanding Requirements**: I have demonstrated a strong ability to review and align my work with guidelines and rubrics, ensuring that all criteria are met effectively. I should continue to carefully analyze requirements and double-check my work against them.  \n",
    "- **Weakness in Time Management**: While I have planned my study and work effectively, I need to focus on adhering to a strict timeline for completing each component to avoid last-minute rushes. Setting smaller, actionable deadlines could help me improve in this area.  \n",
    "- **Strength in Coding Proficiency**: My regular coding practice has enhanced my ability to implement algorithms and debug efficiently, which is a key skill for the CPT. I should maintain this habit and challenge myself with more complex problems to further strengthen my skills.  \n",
    "- **Weakness in Testing Thoroughness**: While I test my programs, I need to focus on improving the depth and variety of test cases to ensure my program handles edge cases effectively. I should make it a priority to design comprehensive test plans for my projects.  \n",
    "- **Strength in Reflection and Revision**: My focus on writing clear responses and revising based on feedback shows my commitment to producing high-quality written components. I should continue to seek constructive feedback and use it to refine my work. \n",
    "\n",
    "**General:** Generally when going into any CPT and PPR questions, I'm gonna have to refference my past projects I worked with individually and as a general group. However questions including some from the PPR would be more inconsistent for me as some parts are incomplete while others are consistent, and could be better pollished for understanding such as adding comments and ideations to my code.\n",
