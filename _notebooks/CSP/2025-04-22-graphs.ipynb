    "- **Edges:** Roads between cities form the edges. If there is a direct road from city A to city B, there is an edge between nodes A and B.\n",
    "- **Weights:** These can represent either the physical distance or the cost of travel between cities. For example, the edge from A to B might have a weight of 5, indicating 5 miles or a $5 cost.\n",

    "### Q1: In which of the configurations is it possible to have redundant routing between devices Q and V?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** C) Both configuration I and configuration II  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Redundant routing means there are multiple independent paths between the devices. Both configurations provide alternative paths from Q to V, allowing communication even if one path is broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: In configuration I, what is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed before device T can no longer communicate with device U?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** B) Two  \n",
    "**Explanation:** There are at least two independent paths connecting T and U. To completely disconnect T from U, both paths would need to be severed. This is characteristic of fault-tolerant or redundant network designs.\n",

    "Reversing the coin order makes the algorithm much less efficient. It uses many more coins because it picks the smallest option every time. This demonstrates that a heuristic like the greedy algorithm can be fast and “good enough” in some cases (like U.S. currency), but not optimal when the order is not ideal.\n",

    "We are examining the effect of reversing the order of coins in the **Greedy Coin Change Algorithm**. The standard approach is `coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]`, which picks the largest coin first. In this activity, we reverse it to `coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]` and see how this affects efficiency.\n",

    "- **Conclusion:** The order in which coins are chosen affects how quickly and efficiently the algorithm arrives at a solution.\n",

    "## Homework Hack Answer: Reflection Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt:\n",
    "Reflect on the effect of changing the coin order, efficiency of different approaches, where greedy algorithms work well or fail, and what you learned from modifying the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing the order of coins in the greedy algorithm greatly increased the number of coins used. The standard greedy strategy used only 6 coins to make 63 cents, while the reversed order used 63 coins. This shows that greedy algorithms work well when the problem structure fits the greedy assumption — such as U.S. coin denominations — but they can fail badly in other cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy algorithms are useful for fast, approximate solutions when computing the perfect solution is too expensive. Changing the order of coin values helped me understand that heuristics trade off optimality for speed and practicality. It highlighted how important problem structure is in determining algorithm performance.\n"
