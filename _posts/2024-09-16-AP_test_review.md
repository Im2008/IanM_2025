1.A:
During 1.A skills, I had a hard time figuring out the differences in the 4 loops and how it can result in an output. Instead of putting that it is possible, I should've put it wasn't possible and that infinite loops cannot solve an undecisive problem. (0/1)

1.B:
During 1.B skills, I should've put identity errors instead of implementing algorithmic solutions. This is beacuse unsolvable problems based from 1.A cannot be solved with algorithms, so letter A couldn't have been true. (0/1)

1.C:
During 1.c skills, I needed to determine citizen science and internet cyber security. I got the citizen science question right,, however, got the internet crowdsource question incorrect as problems cannot be solved through the internet from tools and information. (1/2)

1.D:
For 1.d skills, it was mostly about algorithms and the outputs of each numbers. I feel this was my strongest topic, however still one of my weakest as some algorithms in code are identical to each other, causing some simple mistakes to mess up a code and causing some of my answers to be wrong.(5/13)

2.B:
For 2.B skills, I feel like it was my weakest subject even though I got a much better score than I had on 1.D. I feel as if I got lucky on most questions, as I picked the longest answer out of all of them. For word problems, I should've looked over them, acknowledged the problem, and figure out a solution and something that most definitely doesnt work. (6/8)

3.A:
For 3.A skills, I did weak in boolean reviews as I didn't understand what a boolean was. The way I was able to review for this question was to go back to Sprint 2 lessons and rereview the lessons on 3.2 about booleans and how it coorilates with algorithms. (0/1)

3.B:
For 3.B skills, this was another one of my weakest skills as I got 1/4 of the questions correct inside of the AP test. I feel like I spent too much time on the test, as the question I got correct, I spent under a minute looking over it as the other questions was more than a minute. I feel like I should've just looked at the main idea, find the differences, and make an educated guess based on 2 incorrect answers. (1/4)

3.C:
For 3.C skills, the result was the same as 3.B. I got 1/4 of the questions correct but because I did the questions too fast. The questions were structured more like a word problem, and I should've read through the questions more carefully as to rush them and actually rereview the question to make sure I got it correct (1/4)

4.B:
For 4.B skills, I feel as if I should've taken my time on the questions instead of looking at them as freeby questions. With the questions I got right, I took my time on them, I figured out which ones were correct and incorrect, and acknowledged the right and the wrong. Overall I could've possibly got a 6/6 if I taken my time on these questions. (2/6)

4.C:
For 4.C skills, I feel as if I didn't understand them at all even after reviewing them. What I could do instead is learn what the terms are, and also figure out how I can make myself improve over a time period. If I didn't understand a term, I should've looked to understand what the question was asking, if I didn't know what it was then i'd make an educated guess instead of randomly guessing. (0/4)

5.A:
For 5.A skills, I misinterpreted some terms and as a result, made the 2 questions in that field incorrect. Even though I took my time with these questions and rereviewing them, I should instead just make sure there is a pattern between the questions, and if anything doesn't follow that pattern, I should change that answer. (1/3)

5.B:
For 5.B skills, I should've looked at the question carefully as some questions served different meanings and caused my answers to be way off of the actual outcome of the answer. (2/7)

5.C:
For 5.C skills, I could've taken my time on them yet again instead of trying to rush the questions overall. Instead of seeing the question as simple, I should look over it to make sure the question is what the question is asking, and seeing if the question could be completely different from the actual or not. (0/3)

5.D:
For 5.D skills, When I didn't know the question, I chose the longest answer which resulted me in getting it wrong. Instead of choosing the biggest answer and moving along, I should've actually looked at what the question was asking and making sure the answer I checked has something affiliated with the question that it was asking. (0/1)

5.E: 
For 5.E skills, I should've reread the question as some questions were asking for copyright while others were asking about license which have different coorelations with each other. Instead of rushing through the question, i should've reread the question, looked at which answers should be incorrect, and correct it based of off what is expected. (1/4)

TOTAL: 18/66
