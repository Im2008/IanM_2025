### Purpose of the Program
- **Group Purpose**: The purpose of our groupâ€™s program is to create a multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by Scribble.io. This program allows players to take turns drawing while others guess the word or phrase being illustrated. The goal is to provide an entertaining and interactive way for people to engage in creative gameplay, fostering collaboration, quick thinking, and creativity.

- **Individual Feature**: Timer management and saving/loading drawings.

### Input/Output Requests
- **Frontend API Request and Response**: 
  - **Start Timer**: `/api/start_timer` (POST)
    - **Request**: Starts a new timer with a specified duration.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the timer has started and the duration.
    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "duration": 60 }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Timer started", "duration": 60 }`
  - **Timer Status**: `/api/timer_status` (GET)
    - **Request**: Retrieves the current status of the timer.
    - **Response**: Returns the remaining time and whether the timer is active.
    - **Example Response**: `{ "time_remaining": 45, "is_active": true }`
  - **Save Drawing**: `/api/save_drawing` (POST)
    - **Request**: Saves a drawing sent as a Base64-encoded image.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the drawing has been saved and the filename.
    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "canvasData": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..." }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Drawing saved on server", "filename": "drawing_1616161616.png" }`
  - **Get Drawings**: `/api/get_drawings` (GET)
    - **Request**: Fetches all saved drawings with details.
    - **Response**: Returns a list of saved drawings with filenames, paths, sizes, and last modified times.
    - **Example Response**: 
      ```json
      {
        "status": "success",
        "total_drawings": 2,
        "drawings": [
          {
            "filename": "drawing_1616161616.png",
            "path": "saved_drawings/drawing_1616161616.png",
            "size_in_bytes": 1024,
            "last_modified": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:34:56 GMT"
          },
          {
            "filename": "drawing_1616161620.png",
            "path": "saved_drawings/drawing_1616161620.png",
            "size_in_bytes": 2048,
            "last_modified": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:35:00 GMT"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
  - **Get Times**: `/api/times` (GET)
    - **Request**: Retrieves all time entries from the database.
    - **Response**: Returns a list of time entries.
    - **Example Response**: 
      ```json
      [
        { "users_name": "Alice", "timer": 60, "amount_drawn": 5 },
        { "users_name": "Bob", "timer": 45, "amount_drawn": 3 }
      ]
      ```
  - **Add Time**: `/api/times` (POST)
    - **Request**: Adds a new time entry to the database.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the time entry has been added successfully.
    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "users_name": "Alice", "timer": 60, "amount_drawn": 5 }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry added successfully" }`
- **Postman**: Demonstrate raw API requests and responses with error codes and JSON.
- **Database Operations**: Use `db_init`, `db_restore`, `db_backup` for data management.

### HTTP Methods and Their Usage
- **GET**: Used to retrieve data
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: 
  - Use lists to store drawings and timer states.
  - Use dictionaries to format JSON responses.
- **Formatting Response Data**: Convert Python data structures to JSON for API responses.
- **Database Queries**: Extract data using SQLAlchemy to get lists of times.
- **Class Methods**: CRUD operations for managing time entries in the database.

### Additional HTTP Methods and Their Usage
- **PUT**: Used to update existing data.
  - **Update Time Entry**: `/api/times/<int:time_id>` (PUT)
    - **Request**: Updates an existing time entry with new data.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the time entry has been updated successfully.
    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "users_name": "Alice", "timer": 60, "amount_drawn": 5 }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry updated successfully" }`
- **DELETE**: Used to delete existing data.
  - **Delete Time Entry**: `/api/times/<int:time_id>` (DELETE)
    - **Request**: Deletes an existing time entry.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the time entry has been deleted successfully.
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry deleted successfully" }`

### Updated API Class Methods
- **PUT and DELETE Methods**: 
  - **PUT**: Updates existing time entries in the database.
  - **DELETE**: Removes time entries from the database.
  - Methods include sequencing (steps to process requests), selection (error handling), and iteration (updating or deleting entries).

### Call to Algorithm Requests
- **API Calls**: 
  - Fetch requests to API endpoints for updating and deleting data.
  - Handle responses by updating the DOM or logging errors.
- **Response Handling**: 
  - Different responses based on normal and error conditions.
  - Example: Validating input for updating time entries and handling invalid input.

This segment explains how the additional HTTP methods (PUT and DELETE) are used to update and delete time entries, respectively, and how these methods are implemented in the API.
  

This list summarizes how the API meets the requirements by providing endpoints for managing a drawing competition, handling input/output requests, working with lists and dictionaries, and implementing algorithmic code.
