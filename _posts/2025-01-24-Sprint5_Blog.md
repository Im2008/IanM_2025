### Purpose of the Program
- **Group Purpose**: The purpose of our groupâ€™s program is to create a multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by Scribble.io. This program allows players to take turns drawing while others guess the word or phrase being illustrated. The goal is to provide an entertaining and interactive way for people to engage in creative gameplay, fostering collaboration, quick thinking, and creativity.

        ]
      }
      ```

    - **Request**: Retrieves all time entries from the database.
    - **Response**: Returns a list of time entries.
    - **Example Response**:

    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "users_name": "Alice", "timer": 60, "amount_drawn": 5 }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry added successfully" }`
- **Postman**: Demonstrate raw API requests and responses with error codes and JSON.
- **Database Operations**: Use `db_init`, `db_restore`, `db_backup` for data management.

### HTTP Methods and Their Usage
- **GET**: Used to retrieve data
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: 
  - Use lists to store drawings and timer states.
  - Use dictionaries to format JSON responses.
- **Formatting Response Data**: Convert Python data structures to JSON for API responses.
- **Database Queries**: Extract data using SQLAlchemy to get lists of times.
- **Class Methods**: CRUD operations for managing time entries in the database.

### Additional HTTP Methods and Their Usage
- **PUT**: Used to update existing data.
  - **Update Time Entry**: `/api/times/<int:time_id>` (PUT)
    - **Request**: Updates an existing time entry with new data.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the time entry has been updated successfully.
    - **Example Request Body**: `{ "users_name": "Alice", "timer": 60, "amount_drawn": 5 }`
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry updated successfully" }`
- **DELETE**: Used to delete existing data.
  - **Delete Time Entry**: `/api/times/<int:time_id>` (DELETE)
    - **Request**: Deletes an existing time entry.
    - **Response**: Returns a message indicating the time entry has been deleted successfully.
    - **Example Response**: `{ "message": "Time entry deleted successfully" }`

### Updated API Class Methods
- **PUT and DELETE Methods**: 
  - **PUT**: Updates existing time entries in the database.
  - **DELETE**: Removes time entries from the database.
  - Methods include sequencing (steps to process requests), selection (error handling), and iteration (updating or deleting entries).

### Call to Algorithm Requests
- **API Calls**: 
  - Fetch requests to API endpoints for updating and deleting data.
  - Handle responses by updating the DOM or logging errors.
- **Response Handling**: 
  - Different responses based on normal and error conditions.
  - Example: Validating input for updating time entries and handling invalid input.

This segment explains how the additional HTTP methods (PUT and DELETE) are used to update and delete time entries, respectively, and how these methods are implemented in the API.
  

This list summarizes how the API meets the requirements by providing endpoints for managing a drawing competition, handling input/output requests, working with lists and dictionaries, and implementing algorithmic code.
### Explanation of HTTP Methods with Code Snippets

#### GET Method
The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. In the provided code, the `timer_status` endpoint uses the GET method to fetch the current status of the timer.

```python
@competitors_api.route('/api/timer_status', methods=['GET'])
def timer_status():
  """API endpoint to get the current timer status.
  
  This function handles GET requests to the /api/timer_status endpoint.
  It returns the current state of the timer in JSON format.
  """
  return jsonify(timer_state)

#### POST Method
@competitors_api.route('/api/start_timer', methods=['POST'])
def start_timer():
  """API endpoint to start the timer.
  
  This function handles POST requests to the /api/start_timer endpoint.
  It expects a JSON payload with a "duration" field specifying the timer duration in seconds.
  If the duration is valid, it starts a new timer in a separate thread and returns a success message.
  If the duration is invalid, it returns an error message with a 400 status code.
  """
  global timer_state
  data = request.json
  duration = data.get("duration")

  if not duration or not isinstance(duration, int) or duration <= 0:
    return jsonify({"error": "Invalid duration. Please provide a positive integer."}), 400

  timer_state["is_active"] = False
  thread = threading.Thread(target=timer_thread, args=(duration,))
  thread.start()

  return jsonify({"message": "Timer started", "duration": duration})

#### PUT Method
@competitors_api.route('/api/times/<int:time_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def modify_time(time_id):
  """API endpoint to update an existing time entry.
  
  This function handles PUT requests to the /api/times/<time_id> endpoint.
  It expects a JSON payload with optional fields to update the time entry.
  If the time entry is found, it updates the specified fields and commits the changes to the database.
  If the time entry is not found, it returns an error message with a 404 status code.
  """
  time_entry = Time.query.get(time_id)
  if not time_entry:
    return jsonify({"error": "Time entry not found"}), 404
  
  if request.method == 'PUT':
    data = request.json
    time_entry.users_name = data.get('users_name', time_entry.users_name)
    time_entry.timer = data.get('timer', time_entry.timer)
    time_entry.amount_drawn = data.get('amount_drawn', time_entry.amount_drawn)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Time entry updated successfully"})

#### DELETE Method
@competitors_api.route('/api/times/<int:time_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def modify_time(time_id):
  """API endpoint to delete an existing time entry.
  
  This function handles DELETE requests to the /api/times/<time_id> endpoint.
  If the time entry is found, it deletes the entry from the database and commits the changes.
  If the time entry is not found, it returns an error message with a 404 status code.
  """
  time_entry = Time.query.get(time_id)
  if not time_entry:
    return jsonify({"error": "Time entry not found"}), 404
  
  if request.method == 'DELETE':
    db.session.delete(time_entry)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Time entry deleted successfully"})
```
