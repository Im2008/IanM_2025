# What our website focused on:
On our website, we focused on which beverage people want to be integrated in Del Norte High School. We did this by placing multiple options through a scroll down selection. After they select any beverage by clicking the button, it'll fetch from the backend which was "Ian_backend" and get the file "beverage.py" in order for it to get the users vote, store it into SQ_Lite tables, and put who made that opinion based on python files that direct back to the SQ lite tables like user_managment.db, and we also used voting.db as well.

# My contributions:
-Created the backend file so itll go from my backend to our groups frontend from SQ Lite tables
-Added _init_.py to api and instances so beverage.py can run into SQ Lite Tables.
