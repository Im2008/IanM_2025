# 1.A:
During 1.A skills, I had a hard time figuring out the differences in the 4 loops and how it can result in an output. Instead of putting that it is possible, I should've put it wasn't possible and that infinite loops cannot solve an undecisive problem. (0/1)

# 1.B:
During 1.B skills, I should've put identity errors instead of implementing algorithmic solutions. This is because unsolvable problems based from 1.A cannot be solved with algorithms, so letter A couldn't have been true. (0/1)

# 1.C:
During 1.c skills, I needed to determine citizen science and internet cyber security. I got the citizen science question right,, however, got the internet crowdsource question incorrect as problems cannot be solved through the internet from tools and information. (1/2)

# 1.D:
For 1.d skills, the algorithms and the outputs of each numbers had mostly been identical to each other which made it difficult for me to choose some topics. I feel that although I did the weakest in, I felt it was one of my strongest topic, however still one of my weakest as some algorithms in code are identical to each other, causing some simple mistakes to mess up a code and causing some of my answers to be wrong. To study better for this skill, I will learn how algorithms works through co-pilot and understand it as the trimesters go on. (5/13)

# 2.B (STRONGEST SECTION):
For 2.B skills, I feel like it was my weakest subject even though I got a much better score than I had on 1.D. I feel as if I got lucky on most questions, as I picked the longest answer out of all of them. For word problems, I should've looked over them, acknowledged the problem, and figure out a solution and something that most definitely doesnt work. (6/8)

# 3.A:
For 3.A skills, I did weak in boolean reviews as I didn't understand what a boolean was. The way I was able to review for this question was to go back to Sprint 2 lessons and rereview the lessons on 3.2 about booleans and how it coorilates with algorithms. (0/1)

# 3.B:
For 3.B skills, this was another one of my weakest skills as I got 1/4 of the questions correct inside of the AP test. I feel like I spent too much time on the test, as the question I got correct, I spent under a minute looking over it as the other questions was more than a minute. I feel like I should've just looked at the main idea, find the differences, and make an educated guess based on 2 incorrect answers. (1/4)

# 3.C:
For 3.C skills, the result was the same as 3.B. I got 1/4 of the questions correct but because I did the questions too fast. The questions were structured more like a word problem, and I should've read through the questions more carefully as to rush them and actually rereview the question to make sure I got it correct (1/4)

# 4.B:
For 4.B skills, I feel as if I should've taken my time on the questions instead of looking at them as freeby questions. With the questions I got right, I took my time on them, I figured out which ones were correct and incorrect, and acknowledged the right and the wrong. Overall I could've possibly got a 6/6 if I taken my time on these questions. (2/6)

# 4.C:
For 4.C skills, I feel as if I didn't understand them at all even after reviewing them. What I could do instead is learn what the terms are, and also figure out how I can make myself improve over a time period. If I didn't understand a term, I should've looked to understand what the question was asking, if I didn't know what it was then i'd make an educated guess instead of randomly guessing. (0/4)

# 5.A:
For 5.A skills, I misinterpreted some terms and as a result, made the 2 questions in that field incorrect. Even though I took my time with these questions and rereviewing them, I should instead just make sure there is a pattern between the questions, and if anything doesn't follow that pattern, I should change that answer. (1/3)

# 5.B:
For 5.B skills, I should've looked at the question carefully as some questions served different meanings and caused my answers to be way off of the actual outcome of the answer. (2/7)

# 5.C (WEAKEST SECTION):
For 5.C skills, I could've taken my time on them yet again instead of trying to rush the questions overall. Instead of seeing the question as simple, I should look over it to make sure the question is what the question is asking, and seeing if the question could be completely different from the actual or not. This was byfar my weakest topic, as with the questions I didn't understand, I rushed them and completely skipped the fact at reading the question at all. Since these 3 questions were mostly about word problems, if I looked them over and actually took my time on them, i'd get a decent shot at getting at least one of them right. (0/3)

# 5.D:
For 5.D skills, When I didn't know the question, I chose the longest answer which resulted me in getting it wrong. Instead of choosing the biggest answer and moving along, I should've actually looked at what the question was asking and making sure the answer I checked has something affiliated with the question that it was asking. (0/1)

# 5.E: 
For 5.E skills, I should've reread the question as some questions were asking for copyright while others were asking about license which have different coorelations with each other. Instead of rushing through the question, i should've reread the question, looked at which answers should be incorrect, and correct it based of off what is expected. (1/4)

# Reflection:
Reflecting on the AP assignment, it would've been easier if I taken my time and didn't have to rush for ideas because of a volleyball tournament. I feel like some of the questions I taken were pretty simple, however because I rushed it, I didn't get time to walk through the steps on how the code worked and what I could do to solve the solution. To study for this exam, I'll make sure to understand general vocab from the Advance Placement assignment and be able to utilize it for this coming Trimester and the upcoming Trimester as well.

# Overall:
Overall I believe I was decently strong at understanding problems with code and what the issue was with them in regards to algorithms, booleans, or just number problems. Looking over the problem and actually re-reading them instead of putting an answer to rush it and move on would've made my understanding of the problem a lot more better, and made the other problems easier as it'll pull some concepts from one problem to another. This caused me to struggle a lot especially with the word problems, as they required more thinking and understanding of the topic, which needed to have more time spent on the topic.

# TOTAL: 18/66
