# What I learned from MY LESSON:

# Integers:
Integers is when a variable equals a number, so if you want to have conditions, then it'll work pretty well for integers.

# Floats:
Floats allow decimals to be shown inside of a number, so if you're trying to show integers that have decimals, it'll show!

# Strings:
Strings is when a variable equals a word, so if it equals a number, it isn't a string but its an integer. It is defined if you put "" outside the word that has the variable.

# Lists:
List are the most important part in my opinion, as they're the most useful at organizing strings, integers, and other elements inside a list that'll help call them.

# Tuples:
Tuples are similar to lists, but except you can't change that tuple, and it is mostly used for like coordinates or color marker. Other than that, a tuple is used for specific stuff you want to specify

# Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are when you want another string to be represented from another string. In a similar way, it is like a list, but instead it represents themselve like it. Pretty self explanatory, its like it gives you a word, and gives you a definition just like an english dictionary.

# Sets:
Sets are VERY similar to lists, except you cannot add duplicates of an object, so its even more ordered.

# Booleans
Booleans are really helpful if you want to determine a true or false statement. They're mostly used for conditionals, so if you'd want to define something to be true, it'll be true, opposite applies as well.

# None
None is not really as important, but it still serves its purpose. If you want a variable to equal nothing, you put none, without any "" or [], etc. 

# What I learned:
-How Pseudocode works, and that it serves mostly as a layout of how the rest of the code will function.

-The difference between Python and Javascript code, but the similarities as well.

-How to use conditionals and when to use them in context. Specifically you should use them if you want to set a condition for a variable. For example:

x=1

y=2

if x < y :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("no")

-More information on lists, and how they are essential for organizing stuff. For example:

list = ["Bake: into the oven", "Serve: Finished"]
print(list)

-How strings are essential for defining something and how it can help with conditionals as well. For example:

hello = "hi"
print(hello)

# What group I learned the most
The group that I learned the most was from 3.10 A and 3.10 B because they explained lists pretty well and when you should use them in terms of specifics. For example, you should use a list if you want to make your code more organized, and also if you want to append or remove certain indexes from the lists as they're very flexible unlike sets, dictionaries, or Tuples. They had specific homeworks that defined instances where you should and shouldn't use lists.

# Accomplishments:
---------------------------------------------------
+ Changed and Adjusted hacks based on lessons
+ Adjusted 3.2.4 List lesson so it serves as the most important lesson
+ Added hacks; fixed javascript homework hack so its more dooable, tried to add javascript hacks but failed.
~ Added hover over effect that was later removed
+ Helped some with the notebook organization.
+ Helped some with formatting notebooks, where javascript and python should go.

# Downs:
----------------------------------------------------
- I messed up a lot with the pull requrests and where the files direct to each other.
- Messed up on the main server for the original repository.

# Summary:

Overall I could've done better with the organization of the original team repository that I made for Sprint 2. I had a decent start of how I started out the lesson notebooks, where each directory goes to, and what .html navigation file the part goes to, but when I tried to make a pull request, a lot of unneccessary files were added from the group repo I made resulting in having to create a new one and re copy the notebook organization that I had.

-----------------------------------------------------

# College Board:
I made 
I'm going to prepare better for the CB and the PBL by better understanding lists, making pseudocode for codes, the differences between python and javascript code elements and when to use what, the result of codes, and how to establish the elements into my own code. I'll set up my repository better with a better established python environment and use it as a refference to make my code more established and organized.
