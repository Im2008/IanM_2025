# What I learned from MY LESSON:

# Integers:
Integers is when a variable equals a number, so if you want to have conditions, then it'll work pretty well for integers.

# Floats:
Floats allow decimals to be shown inside of a number, so if you're trying to show integers that have decimals, it'll show!

# Strings:
Strings is when a variable equals a word, so if it equals a number, it isn't a string but its an integer. It is defined if you put "" outside the word that has the variable.

# Lists:
List are the most important part in my opinion, as they're the most useful at organizing strings, integers, and other elements inside a list that'll help call them.

# Tuples:
Tuples are similar to lists, but except you can't change that tuple, and it is mostly used for like coordinates or color marker. Other than that, a tuple is used for specific stuff you want to specify

# Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are when you want another string to be represented from another string. In a similar way, it is like a list, but instead it represents themselve like it. Pretty self explanatory, its like it gives you a word, and gives you a definition just like an english dictionary.

# Sets:
Sets are VERY similar to lists, except you cannot add duplicates of an object, so its even more ordered.

# Booleans
Booleans are really helpful if you want to determine a true or false statement. They're mostly used for conditionals, so if you'd want to define something to be true, it'll be true, opposite applies as well.

# None
None is not really as important, but it still serves its purpose. If you want a variable to equal nothing, you put none, without any "" or [], etc. 

# What I learned:
-How Pseudocode works, and that it serves mostly as a layout of how the rest of the code will function.

-The difference between Python and Javascript code, but the similarities as well.

-How to use conditionals and when to use them in context. Specifically you should use them if you want to set a condition for a variable. 

-More information on lists, and how they are essential for organizing stuff. For example:

list = ["Bake: into the oven", "Serve: Finished"]
print(list)

-How strings are essential for defining something and how it can help with conditionals as well. For example:

hello = "hi"
print(hello)

# What group I learned the most:
The group that I learned from the most was the group that presented lessons 3.3 and 3.5 about Mathmatical Expressions and Booleans. This was because they were more unique than other groups at explaining and comparing coding to real life examples, and utilized this to teach their lesson more fluently on a difficult topic that would normally be hard to explain. Along with this, the flowcharts really helped organize how code typically worked. For example, with Algorithmns, they did a good job comparing it to the "daily life of waking up in the morning" and how it corrilates to how algorithmns need specific tasks to make a list of steps inside the code.
 
# Accomplishments:
---------------------------------------------------
+ Changed and Adjusted hacks based on lessons
+ Adjusted 3.2.4 List lesson so it serves as the most important lesson
+ Added hacks; fixed javascript homework hack so its more dooable, tried to add javascript hacks but failed.
~ Added hover over effect that was later removed
+ Helped some with the notebook organization.
+ Helped some with formatting notebooks, where javascript and python should go.

# Downs:
----------------------------------------------------
- I messed up a lot with the pull requrests and where the files direct to each other.
- Messed up on the main server for the original repository.

# Summary:

Overall I could've done better with the organization of the original team repository that I made for Sprint 2. I had a decent start of how I started out the lesson notebooks, where each directory goes to, and what .html navigation file the part goes to, but when I tried to make a pull request, a lot of unneccessary files were added from the group repo I made resulting in having to create a new one and re copy the notebook organization that I had.

-----------------------------------------------------

# College Board:
I'm going to prepare better for the CB and the PBL by better understanding lists, making pseudocode for codes, the differences between python and javascript code elements and when to use what, the result of codes, and how to establish the elements into my own code. I'll set up my repository better with a better established python environment and use it as a refference to make my code more established and organized.


# SPEECH:
------------------------------------------------------

# Blog - in association with Big Ideas and Teaching, something that shows how you will be prepared for CB and PBL (ie organized accomplishments)
In our Lesson 3.2 Data Abstraction, we split up different data types into different sections in our lesson to organize each data type with its python and javascript version. Through this lesson, i've learned how to set up jupyter notebooks and direct them to a navigation page along with learning where the python and javascript environments are located. I assisted in teaching about (3.2.5) Tuples, (3.2.6) Dictionaries, and how they coorilated similarly to (3.2.4) lists, but serve different purposes whenever you print or log them. Along with this, I adjusted the Javascript hw/popcorn hack to make it more specific to the lesson, and was gonna put a lesson help attached to it with other popcorn hacks but it didn't go through. From these mechanics i've learned, it'll help me be prepared for the CB and PBL by utilizing how each data type works and acknowledging different file directories.

# Memory - something that will helps Teacher or others recall your individual presentation and contribution (ie a highlight)
During our lesson, we used a lot of python and javascript examples, and compared them similary to daily life. For example, for a list its similar to making a list in real life of stuff you want to plot down, and it is similarly kept stored inside something as well. We also added a gimkit that gave an overall summary of 3.2 data abstractions and the different types it had.


# Relevancy - something impactful you learned from another lesson, note source, and try to use relevancy checklist in language (ie a learning)
The One lesson that stood out the most to me was the 3.3 & 3.5 about Mathmatical Expressions & Booleans as the flowcharts and real life example comparisions helped get a grasp of how code could relate to everyday tasks in the real world. Examples such as the specific steps of getting up in the morning in comparison with the desired outcome of an Algorithm helped create a picture of how the code works in the steps of a real world example.

# Beyond Perfunctory - something that shows me that this Sprint on Big Ideas is distinctly yours (ie personal growth or accomplishment)
Starting off, I had a difficult time figuring out how to set up a repository on vscode along with everything being disorganized and out of place. As time went on, I learned how to organize my files into different folders and be able to utilize it for others to understand, especially my teammates. Although I messed up a couple of times in Sprint 2, especially with creating the group repositories, it helped me get a better understanding of how to polish code, work effectively, and process commits that'll help contribute to the team.
