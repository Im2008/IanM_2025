# What I learned from MY LESSON:

# Integers:
Integers is when a variable equals a number, so if you want to have conditions, then it'll work pretty well for integers:

x = 1

y = 2

if x < y :
    print("hi")
else :
    print("NO")



# What I learned:
-How Pseudocode works, and that it serves mostly as a layout of how the rest of the code will function.

-The difference between Python and Javascript code, but the similarities as well.

-How to use conditionals and when to use them in context. Specifically you should use them if you want to set a condition for a variable. For example:

x=1

y=2

if x < y :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("no")

-More information on lists, and how they are essential for organizing stuff. For example:

list = ["Bake: into the oven", "Serve: Finished"]
print(list)

-How strings are essential for defining something and how it can help with conditionals as well. For example:

hello = "hi"
print(hello)

# Accomplishments:
---------------------------------------------------
+ Changed and Adjusted hacks based on lessons
+ Adjusted 3.2.4 List lesson so it serves as the most important lesson
+ Added hacks; fixed javascript homework hack so its more dooable, tried to add javascript hacks but failed.
~ Added hover over effect that was later removed
+ Helped some with the notebook organization.
+ Helped some with formatting notebooks, where javascript and python should go.

# Downs:
----------------------------------------------------
- I messed up a lot with the pull requrests and where the files direct to each other.
- Messed up on the main server for the original repository.

# Summary:

Overall I could've done better with the organization of the original team repository that I made for Sprint 2. I had a decent start of how I started out the lesson notebooks, where each directory goes to, and what .html navigation file the part goes to, but when I tried to make a pull request, a lot of unneccessary files were added from the group repo I made resulting in having to create a new one and re copy the notebook organization that I had.

-----------------------------------------------------

I'm going to prepare better for the CB and the PBL by better understanding lists, making pseudocode for codes, the differences between python and javascript code elements and when to use what, the result of codes, and how to establish the elements into my own code. I'll set up my repository better with a better established python environment and use it as a refference to make my code more established and organized.
