## Terminal -> nighthawk/repository

Go to personal repository. Check all versions (ruby, python, jupyter, bundle).

# **Installing bundle if doesn't work**
sudo apt update ->
sudo gem install bundler

### Sudo Notes:
- Sudo accesses files without permission. **If you are running sudo without knowing what the command does, it isn't easy to restore.**

# **Setting up make**

**Make a python environment:**
scripts/venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate

**On the environment, (venv), run:**
pip install -r requirements.txt
bundle update or bundle install

Then run make
